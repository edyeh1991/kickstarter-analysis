# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends in outcome based on goal amount each campaign will need to succeed, and outcomes based on launch date of the campaign.

### Challenge
Taking a look at the chart Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
![Outcome Based on Launch Date Chart](https://github.com/edyeh1991/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcome%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)

This chart shows us the number of Successful, Failed, and Canceled theatreical play campaigns depending on their launch date.

Theatrical Play campaigns that launched in May and June seemed to have the greatest rate of success.
The trend decreases as the campaigns launch later in the year.
Although there may be a trend that campaigns launched in May or June have the greatest rate of success, we cannot tell from this chart if there are any underlying reasons for the high sucess and low failure rates.

Next, looking at the chart Outcomes Based on Goal:
![Outcome Based on Goal Chart](https://github.com/edyeh1991/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcome%20Based%20on%20Goal%20Chart.png)

The most successful kickstarters were ones with goals ranging from $0 to $1000 with 75.81% of them being successful and 24.19% failing and goals ranging from $1000 to $4999 with 72.66% of them being successful and 27.34% failing. A good goal range to target would indeed be between $0 to $4999. The next step would be to look at the number of backers, their average donations and the lenght of the campaign to see if there is a trend as to whether or not the campaign was sucessful.
