# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analysis of kickstarter campaigns to determine trends in outcome based on goal amount each campaign will need to succeed, and outcomes based on launch date of the campaign.

### Challenge
Taking a look at the chart Outcomes Based on Launch Date:
![Outcome Based on Launch Date Chart](https://github.com/edyeh1991/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcome%20Based%20on%20Launch%20Date.png)
This chart shows us the number of Successful, Failed, and Canceled theatreical play campaigns depending on their launch date.

Theatrical Play campaigns that launched in May and June seemed to have the greatest rate of success.
The trend decreases as the campaigns launch later in the year.
Although there may be a trend that campaigns launched in May or June have the greatest rate of success, we cannot tell from this chart if there are any underlying reasons for the high sucess and low failure rates.

Next, looking at the chart Outcomes Based on Goal:
![Outcome Based on Goal Chart](https://github.com/edyeh1991/kickstarter-analysis/blob/master/Outcome%20Based%20on%20Goal%20Chart.png)
The most successful kickstarters were ones with goals ranging from $45000 to $49999 with 100% of them being successful and goals ranging from $25000 to $29999 with 80% of them being successful and 20% failing. With that being said, there is only 1 campaign with a goal ranging from $45000 to $49999 in which that 1 campaign was successful. Similarly, the 80% sucess rate with campaign goals from $25000 to $29999 included only a total of 5 campaigns. Normalizing the percent outcomes to total number of projects would be most beneficial in informing our decision of target goal.
A more reasonable estimate to tage from the given data is that out of 534 total campaigns, 72.66% of campaigns were successful with a goal ranging from $1000 to $4999.

Further analysis as to the length of the campaign or number of backers and average donation would be interesting to look at to try to determine the trends we see in these 2 charts.
